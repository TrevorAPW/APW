    <font face="Georgia">Here is the promosal for my project: Over the summer, I worked with NYU's Biomolecular Engineering lab and will continue to work with them over the school year. This is a new project that they are undertaking that will involve me doing deep research and coding. I will be working to create a model that will generate the model/sequence of B-Glucosidase, an enzyme. We want to create a model where we will give the model the structure it will provide a sequence, and vice versa. This would, hopefully, make it more time and cost-efficient to find versions of enzymes that are more thermostable and have a longer half-life. </font>
