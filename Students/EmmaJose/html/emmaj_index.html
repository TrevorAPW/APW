  <h1>Emma Jose's Website</h1>
  <p>So far, I have been working on making a Twilio account and getting the details of that set up. Before I work on automating a text message scheduled by someone else, I feel like the best place to start is by establishing how to do it for myself. However, the one issue I have faced thus far is that I can not plug in alternate phone numbers. For some reason, it currently does not want to work, so now my next step is trouble shooting that. </p>
  <p>Here is my project related picture :)</p>
