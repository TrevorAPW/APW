  <h2>Kira Moses Project Updates:</h2>
  <p>10/6/23: This week, I decided that I wanted to 3D print a fidgit spinner for my final project. I downloaded blender and tested out its functions. Before I start designing my spinner, I want to get a full understanding on how blender works.</p>
  <p>10/27/28: This week, I started to create an initial design of my fidgit spinner. I learned how to combine multiple shapes together and how to cut a whole in a sphere. I currently have a rough draft of the design, but I plan to continue altering its shape.</p>
