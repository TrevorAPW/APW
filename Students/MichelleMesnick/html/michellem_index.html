  <h1> Michelle's Game Hub
  <h4>
  <p>For my project, I was thinking about making a game hub. I already started coding a connect 4 game. This game is designed for two players but I would be interested in incorporating a bot to play with - this might require an AI component.
  <p>10/5/23: I set up the board so that the code understands when an object cannot pass through a column. I also created a circle class that allows the objects to understand whos turn it is. 
    <p>11/3/23: I made it so that when a column is clicked, the board knows whos turn it is and if the object can pass. If the object can pass, it will create a circle in the players color on the selected square.  
   <p> 11/15/23: I worked on debugging my code. I met with Mr. Golanka who helped me adjust my program to incorporate for loops. This fixed my problem of having my code run over the objects so now my circles stay on the board. 
    <p> 12/6/23: I worked on adding to the win condition so that my board can identify when a player has won. I also added a function to identify when a column is full, and therefore, an object cannot pass through the function. 
      <p> 12/20/23: I finalized the win condition and worked on some debugging. 
        <p> 2/8/24: My game is almost completed now. My win condition needs some revisions so that it knows when the game is over, however my pieces all go in the correct place on the board and the board can identify when a move is invalid. My next steps are to finish finalizing my win condition so that the game knows when to end. My win condition as of now is pasted below.
