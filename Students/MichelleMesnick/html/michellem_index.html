  <h1> Michelle's Game Hub
  <h4>
  <p>For my project, I was thinking about making a game hub. I already started coding a connect 4 game. This game is designed for two players but I would be interested in incorporating a bot to play with - this might require an AI component.
  <p>10/5/23: I set up the board so that the code understands when an object cannot pass through a column. I also created a circle class that allows the objects to understand whos turn it is.
