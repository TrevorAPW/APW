<p>I have started with my minesweeper project that I am doing with Dylan. We have started to make the boxes using arrays</p>

<p>11/17/23 - Me and Dylan added some design features to improve the apperance of the program</p>

<p>12/8/23 - Me and Dylan restarted using object oriented programming</p>

<p>2/6/24 -  Me and Dylan created the grid, added mines, and made it so you could click a square and make it so you could know if there was a mine there or not.</p>
