            <p>10/17: I am currently waiting to gain access to Codecademy from Mr. Golanka, but once I do, I will begin learning C++ from the attached Codecademy course.
               <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-c-plus-plus" target="_blank">Visit The Course!</a>
            </p>
            <p>10/26: Success! Mr. Golanka has helped me gain access to Codecademy, and I have begun working on my classes. In other programming news, I've worked on a personal project using HTML and JavaScript.
                You can view that website here:

            <p>11/3: My NY Representative Project has only grown! What was once a simple email lookup project is now a more complicated script that takes several user inputs and uses them to generate an email from a script with the inputs.
                The original representative lookup function has also been evolved to include state senators as well as assembly members. The link above has been updated.
            </p>
            <p>11/9: I have begun looking into how to include zip code as an input to replace the need for users to type in the name of the representative they are looking for.
                I am considering using an API to help with this, as well as other ways to execute this goal, which will make the user experience better. I've also begun work on my original C++ Codecademy course (link still above).
            </p>
            <p>11/17: In classic web developer fashion, I have become frustrated with my NY Representative Email project, and have decided to take a break for a few weeks.
                I have become more proficient with C++ through the Codecademy course, and am just now starting to get used to having to compile and execute my code through the terminal.
            </p>
            <p>12/8: I have dived back into my original web page after a break, and am still working around a way to involve user zip codes. A promising tool has been the Google Civics API, which I am still investigating.
                I have also begun brainstorming a substantial project to demonstrate my C++ knowledge. More updates to follow.

            <h2>Update: 2/8</h2>
            <p>I have been working on a variety of webpages for non-CS classes and am planning on creating a portfolio for them. This portfolio will showcase the diverse range of projects I've undertaken, highlighting my skills and creativity in web development. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

            <h2>Class Projects</h2>
            <p>As part of my coursework and personal projects, I've developed several webpages that I'm proud to showcase. These projects have allowed me to apply my learning in real-world scenarios, contributing to my understanding and skills in web development.</p>
