  <p> print: Hello World!</p>
  <p> print: awesome </p>
  <p> print: Project progress: I have decided to make a realistic-looking 3-D printed hand for my project 
    (like the ones used in neuroscience experiments).
    With Mr. Lindows' help, I have gone through UltiMaker Thingiverse and have drawn some inspiration from previous projects. For this
  project, I will be using Blender for the coding and design aspects. While I haven't yet designed a hand, I have practiced making simple shapes
  on Blender and trying to figure out how to use all the different features before making my first model of the hand I want to print. </p>
