  <p>  Project progress: I have decided to make a realistic-looking 3-D printed hand for my project 
    (like the ones used in neuroscience experiments).
    With Mr. Lindows' help, I have gone through UltiMaker Thingiverse and have drawn some inspiration from previous projects. For this
  project, I will be using Blender for the coding and design aspects. While I haven't yet designed a hand, I have practiced making simple shapes
  on Blender and trying to figure out how to use all the different features before making my first model of the hand I want to print. </p>
  <p> 10/20/23: I have spent some time working with Chris on learning the key codes for MacBooks to use Blender and have starting making a basic model of a 3D printed hand </p>
  <p> 10/26/23: Today I finished desinging a basic model of a 3D hand. I have to work on making it look more realistic and have to work on rounding out and shaping the fingers and palm. These were some of my steps: </p>
