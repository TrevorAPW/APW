                2 / 8 / 2024: My role within the project is dually working on the lore of the game and helping with any code or 3D 
                modeling that other members whose primary role this is included in don't want or have the time to do. Thusfar, I have 
                worked on developing the "PA guy" a mischevious character who will be the main source of information for the player and 
                will be equal parts helpful and unhelpful. However he will be completely mischevious. Additionally I have started 
                work on the notes that will be found around the map that not only help the player understand the lore of the game but 
                also give hints about new mechanics or secrets. Additionally I have started brainstorming a new creature known as the 
                Mimic. The Mimic will scrap the players models and take voice lines from the character in order to try and lure them into
                traps or ambushes. The scrapped models will resemble the player but have very clear districtions and distrotions that 
                differentiate them. I don't have any images to share because the majority of what I have currently is text on a doc but 
                I will gladly share that in class.
