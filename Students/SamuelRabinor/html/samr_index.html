                        You might have noticed this project is labeled as 0 in the list. 
                        That's because this is a project that I started last year during 
                        an independent study! This project originated with a simulation 
                        in which a program my classmates and I were guided through randomly 
                        generated some attributes-<em>strength, health, etc...</em>-for two 
                        characters. It then simulated combat between the two, alternating turns
                        with each character eating food to heal and attacking the other until one 
                        of them died.

                        <br><br>
                        I enjoyed the concept and wanted to expand upon it, so I decided to take 
                        this concept and developed it further, adding a randomized map, character 
                        customization and a lot more. I did not finish the game for reasons explained 
                        in this years project labeled <strong><em>"Learning C++"</em></strong>, however I did 
                        create a large amount of code and framework for the game which can be found on 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Tavnik-7-8-22/Tbag_Python.git" target="_blank">github</a> or you can download the files

                        Unfortunately I did not maintain a dev_log during my time coding this project,
                        however I intend to keep one on any future projects I take on!

                        Labeled as 1 in the list, this is the project I intend to take on 
                        this year. As mentioned in the <strong><em>Text based adventure game project</em></strong>,
                        I never fully completed my game in Python. This is due in large part to how dificult Python 
                        is to code with when it comes to game development. Towards the end of my work on that project 
                        I began reaserching different languages that might facilitate the process of coding my game 
                        idea. That is when I discovered C++.
                        <br><br>
                        Attracted by the language's object oriented code and direct memory access, and backed by it's 
                        usage in several large companies who work in game development I decided to try and learn it. 
                        So far I have used two sources, the first is a playlist of 101 videos by a youtuber called 
                        <em>The Cherno</em>. You can check out his channel by clicking his name, he has a multitude 
                        of playlists on more than just C++, if you want a link to the C++ playlist you can find that 
                        <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&feature=shared"
                        target="_blank">here</a>. The second resource I have used is a variety of courses on a website 
                        called Codecadamy, an online platform with lessons for all programming levels which can be found 
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        <br><br>

                        This project is a combination of the two projects that precede it. While Python is an amazing 
                        language to code in, it is very difficult to create a game the way that I wanted to. I chose 
                        not to use some of the add-ons that would have made this project simpler such as PyGame (a 
                        cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games). Opting instead to try 
                        and code the game from the ground up myself. This is ultimately the reason that I ended the 
                        project where I did as well, as there were certain things I was having a very hard time doing.
                        <br><br>
                        Drawn in by the appeals I mentioned in <strong><em>Learning C++</em></strong>, I decided I would 
                        continue to work on my game from the ground up the way I wanted to. Using C++ would help me facilitate
                        this process, however I didn't want to comepletely drop all of the work I had put in during my time 
                        working in Python. So I decided that once I had learned C++ and gained an understanding of how it 
                        worked I would translate all of the code from Python over to the best of my abilities. This way, I 
                        wouldn't lose any of the time and work I put in to the Python version and already have a big headstart 
                        on finishing the game once I translated everything over.

                        The following project description was taken from the website of the person I intend to collaborate 
                        with through out this project as they will be the main dev and were the one who suggested I join to
                        help create this:
                        From William Kamfar - I want to make a multiplayer 2D or 2.5D (3D models in a 2D space) fighting game 
                        like Guilty Gear -Strive- or BlazBlue Centralfiction with Visual Novel elements for story telling in 
                        C# using Unity. This has been a passion project of mine for a while, and I want this game to create cool 
                        moments, and generate a sizable dedicated community like with Street Fighter Third Strike and 
                        <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0">Evo Moment 37</a>. I want to add a cast of 
                        unique characters that are all fun to play, and embody the different fighting styles throughout the 
                        genre's history. Along with this cast, I want to add unique system / universal mechanics for this game 
                        as well as adding a Roman Cancel system (from Guilty Gear) as I really enjoy using it. I also want to 
                        add a soundtrack reminiscent of my favorite entries to the genre, as well as maps that take place at 
                        beautiful, stylistic vistas. If I have time, along with the fighting game itself, I want to add a story 
                        mode that really works to add more depth to the characters.
                        <br><br>
                        A dev_log for this project can likely be found on William Kamfar's page.
