                        You might have noticed this project is labeled as 0 in the list. 
                        That's because this is a project that I started last year during 
                        an independent study! This project originated with a simulation 
                        in which a program my classmates and I were guided through randomly 
                        generated some attributes-<em>strength, health, etc...</em>-for two 
                        characters. It then simulated combat between the two, alternating turns
                        with each character eating food to heal and attacking the other until one 
                        of them died.

                        <br><br>
                        I enjoyed the concept and wanted to expand upon it, so I decided to take 
                        this concept and developed it further, adding a randomized map, character 
                        customization and a lot more. I did not finish the game for reasons explained 
                        in this years project labeled <strong><em>"Learning C++"</em></strong>, however I did 
                        create a large amount of code and framework for the game which can be found on 
                        <a href="https://github.com/Tavnik-7-8-22/Tbag_Python.git" target="_blank">github</a> or you can download the files

                        Unfortunately I did not maintain a dev_log during my time coding this project,
                        however I intend to keep one on any future projects I take on!

                        Labeled as 1 in the list, this is the project I intend to take on 
                        this year. As mentioned in the <strong><em>Text based adventure game project</em></strong>,
                        I never fully completed my game in Python. This is due in large part to how dificult Python 
                        is to code with when it comes to game development. Towards the end of my work on that project 
                        I began reaserching different languages that might facilitate the process of coding my game 
                        idea. That is when I discovered C++.
                        <br><br>
                        Attracted by the language's object oriented code and direct memory access, and backed by it's 
                        usage in several large companies who work in game development I decided to try and learn it. 
                        So far I have used two sources, the first is a playlist of 101 videos by a youtuber called 
                        <em>The Cherno</em>. You can check out his channel by clicking his name, he has a multitude 
                        of playlists on more than just C++, if you want a link to the C++ playlist you can find that 
                        <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&feature=shared"
                        target="_blank">here</a>. The second resource I have used is a variety of courses on a website 
                        called Codecadamy, an online platform with lessons for all programming levels which can be found 
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        <br><br>

                        This project is a combination of the two projects that precede it. While Python is an amazing 
                        language to code in, it is very difficult to create a game the way that I wanted to. I chose 
                        not to use some of the add-ons that would have made this project simpler such as PyGame (a 
                        cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games). Opting instead to try 
                        and code the game from the ground up myself. This is ultimately the reason that I ended the 
                        project where I did as well, as there were certain things I was having a very hard time doing.
                        <br><br>
                        Drawn in by the appeals I mentioned in <strong><em>Learning C++</em></strong>, I decided I would 
                        continue to work on my game from the ground up the way I wanted to. Using C++ would help me facilitate
                        this process, however I didn't want to comepletely drop all of the work I had put in during my time 
                        working in Python. So I decided that once I had learned C++ and gained an understanding of how it 
                        worked I would translate all of the code from Python over to the best of my abilities. This way, I 
                        wouldn't lose any of the time and work I put in to the Python version and already have a big headstart 
                        on finishing the game once I translated everything over.
                        <br><br>

                        This information is taken from William Kamfar's website which can be found on <a href=../../WilliamKamfar/html/williamk_index.html >William's webpage</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        Arachnid is a crossplay VR and PC multiplayer survival horror game that focuses on creating a sense of 
                        dread for the player. This project has been divided among multiple people in a way that allows them to each 
                        have a separate project that combines into one larger product at the end. In this game, you will be a group 
                        of exterminators sent to eliminate the Arachnid, a mysterious creature that lurks in the dark... While the 
                        lore and exact gameplay have not been fully planned out yet, the core idea is that the player will be navigating 
                        environments with several other players in order to hunt this creature. There will be several other creatures 
                        that the character has to deal with, and they have to manage their limited resources in order to survive. 
                        Check out the game at: <a href="https://swankypantsu.itch.io/arachnid-vr-horror-game?secret=EeUxw3YtwvfHWZHd6REq4XJto">Arachnid.Itch.io</a>. 
                        It will most likely be on Steam at some point, and you can check out the devlog channel at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SwankyStudios">Swanky Studios</a>.
                        My personal devlog can be found <a href="samr_project(Arachnid).html">here</a> and 
                        moving forward I will start updating this with my progress on the project.
