                12 / 8 / 2024 and 1 / 18 / 2025: This project originated far enough back that I don't remember the exact date. The 
                project was originally intended to be a game in the Monogame engine. However upon learning and researching the GoDot 
                engine we decided to transfer our progress to it. We are currently working on the game in the GoDot engine. My role in 
                the project is to assist with the code where necessary and design all of the art and related code. Amara Singer's, my 
                fellow developer is primarily taking charge of the code. Thusfar I have gone through a variety of sprites and animations 
                for the main character named "Synk". These designs were ultimately scrapped and I am currently working on a new design 
                for the character that will be able to function with a dynamic movement system which I will also be coding. Once I am 
                finished with the character design I will begin working on the tileable map and applying the movement system to other 
                creatures and enemies. I will also be working on the UI and menu system for the game. We plan to have dynamic generation 
                wherever possible to increase the replayability of the game. We are also planning to have a variety of different enemies 
                and interactable characters. We are also planning to have a variety of different weapons and items that can be used by the 
                player which I will help code. If you have any question I can speak more in depth and answer them all in person. This is 
                not the only project I am working on, though it is the only one I have an active dev-log for. If you want to know more about 
                my other projects I can speak about them in person.

                2 / 8 / 2024: For an increasingly long time I have been struggling with artists block and been unable to come up with ideas 
                that would function in the new required art style. Recently I finally broke out of that and have begun work on the new model 
                for Synk. I don't have any images to share quite yet but I hopefully will by next update as I hope to get a model established 
                so I an begin working on the animations. I have also been working on the movement system and have been able to get the parts to 
                move independently and based reactively on the environment.
