                10/6/23: Date project is scheduled to start. I am unfortunatly still waiting for the subscription to Codecadamy
                in order to begin my project. I have, however, been researching and learning independently so I feel as though as 
                soon as we get the subscription I am ready to dive right into even some intermediate topics. However I still want 
                to review and ensure I understand the basics enough to be able to explain it to someone new to coding.

                10/17/23: I am still pending access to the Codecadamy subscription, we set up the account but are now having trouble 
                logging into it so I still don't have access to it. Whenever I do get access I will start working on learning the 
                language.

                11/3/23: Thusfar I have completed 69% (yes I am serious this not a joke) of the course I set out to complete. In addition, 
                I aquired a new resource called the GameDevRocket from a developer that goes by the name of Blackthornprod. I hope to use 
                this additional resource to progress my game development with the new skills I learned from the C++ course.
            </li>
            <li>
                11/15/23: I have completed the c++ course on Codecadamy. Moving forward, I intend to start a new course on C#, the language 
                used in unity (the game engine I am coding in). My knoweledge of C++ should help expedite the process exponentially. I 
                additionally intend to officially start using the GameDevRocket resource to improve my game developmemnt capabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                11/8/23: I have officially concluded this porject. I have taken on a new project, me and Amara Singer are now coding a game 
                together in addition to my projects currently in existance. I am learning unity with the GameDevRocket course and am learning 
                Monogame for my project with Amara Singer. I am using an online tutorial and resources from Codecadamy to do this.
