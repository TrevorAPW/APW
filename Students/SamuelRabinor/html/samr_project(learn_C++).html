                10/6/23: Date project is scheduled to start. I am unfortunatly still waiting for the subscription to Codecadamy
                in order to begin my project. I have, however, been researching and learning independently so I feel as though as 
                soon as we get the subscription I am ready to dive right into even some intermediate topics. However I still want 
                to review and ensure I understand the basics enough to be able to explain it to someone new to coding.

                10/17/23: I am still pending access to the Codecadamy subscription, we set up the account but are now having trouble 
                logging into it so I still don't have access to it. Whenever I do get access I will start working on learning the 
                language.
