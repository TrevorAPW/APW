    <h1>Arachnid-Owen</h1>

    <p>So far I’ve made a gun script with a few facets to it. It has sound, bullet casing ejections, muzzle flash, reloading, hit detection, and reload cancelling. Next thing I’ll add is dynamic ammo count and integrating animations.</p>

    <p> I’m also working on an enemy AI, I want it to be able to detect sound and also dampen the sound if it goes through a wall, and I want it to chase the player step by step instead of continuous movement every frame.</p>

    <p> Dec&Jan I've revamped the ai, as we have a new map-making system. We're now using a grid based system to build the map instead of having a prebuilt map that I could bake a navmesh on, so I'm going to calculate which points in the grid are walls and which are walkable to create a new pathfinding system. Also, I've added a grenade.</p>
