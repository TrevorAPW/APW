<h1>Sam Asner's Project Log</h1>

<p>10/4/23: I've made some good progress on my project. I've familariazed myself with Processing again, and started messing around with 
different movement options for my game. So far, I've created a simple bit of code with a shape that can smoothly jump, and a counter
that counts the amount of jumps. This is far from the final product, but right now I'm just trying to experiment in Processing
so that I have a good foundation of knowledge on which to build my game.</p>
