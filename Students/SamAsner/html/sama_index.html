<p>10/4/23: I've made some good progress on my project. I've familariazed myself with Processing again, and started messing around with 
different movement options for my game. So far, I've created a simple bit of code with a shape that can smoothly jump, and a counter
that counts the amount of jumps. This is far from the final product, but right now I'm just trying to experiment in Processing
so that I have a good foundation of knowledge on which to build my game.</p>

<p>10/19/23: I've started working on ways to mimick motion within processing. I created a kind of endless forward animation with a rectangle 
that grows bigger and then creates a new rectangle as soon as the previous one hits the sides. This gives a kind of endless hallway effect and 
I think it would be a really cool and asethically pleasing addition to my game.</p>

<p>11/02/23: I've begun to work on collision between the two objects in my game. I made it so as the larger ball gets to a certian size and
the smaller ball is within the bigger ball, It creates a death message. The bones of my game are looking really good and I think besides some 
Additional mechanics and movement updates, all it needs is a decent polish.</p>
